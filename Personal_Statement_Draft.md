# UMich (Junior + Senior)

In March, 2024, I was successfully admitted by CoE at UMich - Ann Arbor, which offers a large variety of opportunities in providing solutions for interdisciplinary applications, especially in wearable robotics systems. 

<!-- Open-Source Leg Project General Statement -->
In March 2024, I began working at the Neurobionics Lab in Robotics Department on the project "Open-Source Leg", which mainly contains my contributions on 2 aspects. 

<!-- Open-Source Leg Project Detailed Statement -->
Firstly, I help designed a generalized software library that is neutral to hardware choices, and empowers more freedom to user designs. While the original software library for the open-source leg is biased for a specific set of hardware components, the new version of software library is generalized to offer a structure for implementing hardware choices, thus allowing the development of various prostheses devices with common standard features. 

Moreover, I help designed a series spring architecture that possesses larger energy density and better low-stiffness performances, thus further spanning the design space for series elastic actuators. 

 

<!-- Emphasis on "PEOPLE FIRST ENGINEERING", thus clarify my motivation in prosthesis + exoskeleton -->
What attracts me most in CoE is the philosophy of "people-first engineering", which allows me to make it
