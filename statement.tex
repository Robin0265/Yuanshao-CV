\section{Research Statement}

    \subsection{Background \& Motivation}

    Research in Wearable Robotics Systems, such as prosthesis and exoskeleton, has advanced at a swift pace to the point where benefiting people with disabilities. However, most of these systems fail to offer a smooth experience for addressing the locomotor deficits of disabled people, due to a lack of bidirectional feedback between human locomotion and Mechatronics system. 

    

    \subsection{Research Questions}
        Based on the background stated above, my research questions, which also serve for the focus of my research, are as follows:
        \begin{itemize}
                
                \item {How the fundamental actuator modes are combined, in order to mimic human gaits?}
                \item {How mechanical design is developed to aid the interactions between Mechatronics systems and environments?}
        
        \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Goals \& Perspectives}

        I strive to improve experience of interactions between wearable robotics systems and disabled people.

        On the one hand, I help create mechanical designs for the components of the series elastic actuator, lying a foundation for the robust gait phase control. 
            
        On the other hand, I also help create finite state machines, such as mode transitions for the control states, to make gait phase controls more robust in automation processes.

    \subsection{Future Agenda}

        My long term research goal is to to investigate more on human locomotion, and develop corresponding control strategies \& mechanical design to improve experience of interactions between people + prosthesis / exoskeletons and environments \cite{SpringDesign_OSL}
