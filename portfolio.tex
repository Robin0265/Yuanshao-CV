\section{Software Generalization for \href{https://www.opensourceleg.org/}{Open-Source Leg}}


\subsection{Background}

% -- BACKGROUND BEGINS -- % 


% WHAT IS OPENSOURCELEG
% -- DRAWNBACK / GAP: HOW / WHY IT IS NOT GENERALIZED ENOUGH -- %
The Open-Source Leg project is a standardized hardware and software platform for prosthesis designs, controls, and tests, aimed to eliminate the barriers among different prosthesis researches and serve as a bridge for collaborative efforts in prosthetic leg design and control. Such platform is expected to be flexible towards hardware choices. However, the previous versions of Open-Source Leg software library is biased to a specific hardware choice, which fails to close the gap between individual researches and adds difficulty in comparing experiment results. 

% -- MOTIVATION: A MORE GENERALIZED OPENSOURCELEG -- %
Thus, a generalized, user-friendly version of the software library is needed to serve as a basis for alternative prosthetic leg forks. Such library will allow other researchers to create their version of prosthetic leg with lower costs and more standardized features, in order to offer a common platform for researchers to test and evaluate further control strategies and mechanical designs.

\section{Motion Analysis \& Design of Robot Swimmer Model}


\subsection{Background}

Targeting transport is an emerging field in the medical industry that is attempting to obtain a more precise cure for the diseased area in the human body. Although attempts such as targeted therapy are performed, they still inherits the same problem that both the location and the amount of optimal dosing are hard to be controlled. 

Therefore, a complete robot swimmer model should be developed to perform the task, due to its better performance than chemical-based therapies. Such design aims to offer a feasible solution for future research in control strategies for robot swimmers, in order to achieve better performances in targeting transportation. 



\subsection{Objectives}

\begin{enumerate}
    
    \item {Develop a mechanical model with sphere head and flagella, and the corresponding kinematics model, that is suitable to perform object tracking.}
    \item {}
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Results}

\begin{enumerate}

    \item {Mechanical Design of the Components of Robot Swimmer, with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis to validate the design.}
    \item {Kinematics Analysis of the Robot Swimmer Model.}
    \item {Control strategies applied to the Robot Swimmer Model (Feedback Control \& Feedforward Control), with performance evaluation in simulations.}
