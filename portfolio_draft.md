# Development of Robot Swimmer Model

## Motivation / Background

- Targeting Transport is an emerging field in the medical industry to obtain a more precise cure for the diseased area. This transport process requires a robot transporter to reach the target.

- Traditional methods made designs of robot transporter less effective to do targeting transport, which motivates me to put forward advanced designs and apply a more effective control strategy


## Research Question / Objective

This design aims to:

- design the mechanical features of the swimming robot and validate the design with simulations
- develop a control model for the robot's path planning, trajectory tracking, and automatic error correction
- offer a feasible solution for future research in controlling Robot-Swimmer motions 

## Results / Outcomes

1. A robot **model** with sphere head and quad flegella

# Automated Vehicle with Tracking System

## Motivation

- 

## Research Question / Objective

- 

## Results

1. A camera module that recognizes a corresponding object (a tennis ball) and measures its approximate distance from the camera, through YOLO-V3. 


2. A Gimbal Stabilizer that holds the camera module and performs object tracking

# Clinical Data Analysis

## Motivation

- AI's reference is needed for a quicker, more precise diagnostics, for early prevention / effective therapy of curing common heart diseases. 

## Research Questions / Objectives

- Develop a classification model (based on `random forest` model) to do quick and precise classification of common heart diseases by causes (e.g. age, chest pain type, etc)

- Optimize the model to be interpretable and precise in classifications [by `Interpretability analysis`]

## Results

- Random Forest Model to classify heart diseases
