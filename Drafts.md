# Research Statement Portfolio

## Background

```
Aaron's example: 

    <!-- 404 -->

```

```
Sherry's example: 

    - Research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has advanced at an incredible pace, to the point where it is making its way into our everyday lives, explicitly and behind the scenes. However, beneath their impressive progress, many AI models hide deficiencies that amplify social biases (e.g., chatbot assistants making inappropriate or unfair responses to certain questions) or even cause fatal accidents (auto-driving scenarios).

    [Prosthesis / Exoskeleton < -- > Human Locomotion, how they are benefit to each other]
 -->

<!-- - Background of Human Locomotion, Prosthesis - Exoskeleton Development -->

Research in Wearable Robotics Systems, such as prosthesis and exoskeleton, has advanced at a swift pace to the point where benefiting people with disabilities. 


<!-- - However - Dilemma / Conflict -> *Research Question* -->

However, most of these systems fail to offer a \[smooth experience\] for addressing the locomotor deficits of disabled people, due to a lack of bidirectional feedback between human locomotion and Mechatronics system. 


## Research Questions

```
Aaron's example: 

    - how does the controller adjust to provide variable walking speed, and transition between different tasks

    - how the control affect human biomechanics in a range of activities, focus on test with human with devices
```

```
Sherry's example: 

    - How do we identify, improve, and cope with imperfect models, while still benefiting from their use?
```

**Tentative**:

Based on the background stated above, my research questions, which also serve for the focus of my research, are as follows:

- How mechanical design is developed to aid the interactions between Mechatronics systems and environments? [--> `Series-Elastic Actuation`]

- How the fundamental actuator modes are combined, in order to mimic human gaits? [--> `Finite State Machine Design for Prosthesis`]


## Goals & Perspective (Primary) 

```
Aaron's example: 

    - to improve ambulation with people with walking disabilities
```

```
Sherry's example: 

    - to empower humans to debug and correct AI models interactively. 
    
        - help AI experts run scalable and testable analyses on models in development
        - help end users collaborate with deployed AIs in a transparent and controllable manner
```
<!-- 
**Tentative**: 

- to improve experience of interaction between prostheses / exoskeletons and people with walking disabilities
    
    *General description of what I did should go here*

    - develop control strategies that mimics dynamic behavior of human limbs

    - develop elastic elements design to improve robustness of the control system -->

I strive to improve experience of interactions between wearable robotics systems and disabled people.

## Experiences \& Outcomes (Brief Review)

```
Aaron's example: 

- sensors 

    - mechanical, wearable, EMG -> sensor fusion

- Control system architecture

    - high, mid, low level ctrl

```

```
Sherry's example: 

- Probes the intersection between HCI and NLP
    
    - conduct user studies 
    - interactive tool design

```

**Tentative**: 

- A `Finite State Machine` that operates on the 3-Phase BLDC motor, serving as basis of gait phase control

- A `Series Spring Design` that is energy-dense and compact, and a modelling of `backlash effect` in the springs, serving as part of SEA to perform precise and robust control

## Experiences & Outcomes (Project Specific Description)

```
Aaron's example: 

- power knee / ankle

- power hip exo

- terrain park

```

```
Sherry's example: 

- expert debugging of AI in DEV

- end user debugging of AI in SITU

```

<!-- **Tentative**: 

- Implementation and application of `Voltage Mode`, `Current Mode`, `Position Mode`, and `Impedance Mode` to form a basis of `Finite State Machine`. 

    ==Finite State Machine Graph goes here==

- Torsional spring with different stiffness and identical outer + contact radius, assembly parts design, and modelling of `backlash effect`. 

    ==Series Spring Design CAD goes here==

    ==Backlash Model FBD and T-theta diagram goes here== -->

## Future Agenda

```
Aaron's example: 

    <!-- 404 -->

```

```
Sherry's example: 

- making human-AI interactions more aware of use scenes, and more ~ of human capabilities 

- explore more efficient ways to collect and use benchmark datasets in the context of high-stake apps

- design models that allow to intuitively understand and steer AI

- collaborate in phycology and social science
```

**Tentative**: 

- Ultimate Research goal: to investigate more on human locomotion, and develop corresponding control strategies & mechanical design to improve experience of interactions between people + [prosthesis / exoskeletons] and environments
