# Research Statement

1. Background

```
Sherry's example: 

    Research in Artifcial Intelligence (AI) has advanced at an incredible pace, to the point where it is making its way into our everyday lives, explicitly and behind the scenes. However, beneath their impressive progress, many AI models hide defciencies that amplify social biases (e.g., chatbot assistants making inappropriate or unfair responses to certain questions) or even cause fatal accidents (auto-driving scenarios).

2. Research Questions

```
Aaron's example: 

    - how does the controller adjust to provide variable walking speed, and transition between different tasks

    - how the control affect human biomechanics in a range of activities, focus on test with human with devices
```

```
Sherry's example: 

    - How do we identify, improve, and cope with imperfect models, while still benefiting from their use?
```

**Tentative**:

    - How the fundamental actuator modes are combined, in order to mimic human gaits? [--> `Finite State Machine Design for Prosthesis`]

    - How mechanical design is developed to aid the interactions between Mechatronics systems and environments? [--> `Series-Elastic Actuation`]

3. Goals & Perspective (Primary) 

```
Aaron's example: 

    - to improve ambulation with people with walking disabilities
```

```
Sherry's example: 

    - to empower humans to debug and correct AI models interactively. 
    
        - help AI experts run scalable and testable analyses on models in development
        - help end users collaborate with deployed AIs in a transparant and controllable manner
```

**Tentative**: 

    - to improve experience of interaction between prostheses / exoskeletons and people with walking disabilities
        
        - help develop control strategies that mimics dynamic behavior of human limbs

        - help develop mechanical designs to be combined with
